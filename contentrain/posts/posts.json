    "content": "\nThree hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago\nto-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple\ncircuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.\n\nThe sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has\npreserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus\nset the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.\nIt was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt\nled along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor\nan entry of “our much dread lord, monsieur the king,” nor even a pretty\nhanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it\nthe arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and\nbedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that\nnature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the\nmarriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its\nentry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon,\nwho, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an\namiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and\nto regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a very “pretty morality,\nallegorical satire, and farce,” while a driving rain drenched the\nmagnificent tapestries at his door.\n\nWhat put the “whole population of Paris in commotion,” as Jehan de Troyes\nexpresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity, united\nfrom time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools.\n\nOn that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Grève, a maypole at\nthe Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. It had\nbeen cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the\ncross roads, by the provost’s men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless\ncoats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts.\n\nSo the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and\nshops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of\nthe three spots designated.\n\nEach had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another,\nthe mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the\nloungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their\nsteps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the\nmystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de\nJustice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that\nthe curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone\nbeneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque.\n\nThe populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because\nthey knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days\npreviously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery,\nand at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place\nin the grand hall.\n\nIt was no easy matter on that day, to force one’s way into that grand\nhall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in\nthe world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of\nthe Château of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people,\noffered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into\nwhich five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every\nmoment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented\nincessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here\nand there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the\nplace. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* façade of the palace, the grand\nstaircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which,\nafter parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves\nalong its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled\nincessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the\nlaughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise\nand a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled;\nthe current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed\nbackwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the\nbuffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants, which\nkicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has\nbequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the _maréchaussée_,\nthe _maréchaussée_ to our _gendarmeri_ of Paris.",

    "content": "Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration\nunanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when\nhe reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence,\nthe cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder\nof hooting.\n\n“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the\npeople. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was\naudible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence\ninstantly!” yelped the scholar.\n\n“Down with Jupiter and the Cardinal de Bourbon!” vociferated Robin\nPoussepain and the other clerks perched in the window.\n\n“The morality this very instant!” repeated the crowd; “this very instant!\nthe sack and the rope for the comedians, and the cardinal!”\n\nPoor Jupiter, haggard, frightened, pale beneath his rouge, dropped his\nthunderbolt, took his cap in his hand; then he bowed and trembled and\nstammered: “His eminence—the ambassadors—Madame Marguerite of\nFlanders—.” He did not know what to say. In truth, he was afraid of\nbeing hung.\n\nHung by the populace for waiting, hung by the cardinal for not having\nwaited, he saw between the two dilemmas only an abyss; that is to say, a\ngallows.\n\nLuckily, some one came to rescue him from his embarrassment, and assume\nthe responsibility.\n\nAn individual who was standing beyond the railing, in the free space\naround the marble table, and whom no one had yet caught sight of, since\nhis long, thin body was completely sheltered from every visual ray by the\ndiameter of the pillar against which he was leaning; this individual, we\nsay, tall, gaunt, pallid, blond, still young, although already wrinkled\nabout the brow and cheeks, with brilliant eyes and a smiling mouth, clad\nin garments of black serge, worn and shining with age, approached the\nmarble table, and made a sign to the poor sufferer. But the other was so\nconfused that he did not see him. The new comer advanced another step.\n\n“Jupiter,” said he, “my dear Jupiter!”\n\nThe other did not hear.\n\nAt last, the tall blond, driven out of patience, shrieked almost in his\nface,—\n\n“Michel Giborne!”\n\n“Who calls me?” said Jupiter, as though awakened with a start.\n\n“I,” replied the person clad in black.\n\n“Ah!” said Jupiter.\n\n“Begin at once,” went on the other. “Satisfy the populace; I undertake to\nappease the bailiff, who will appease monsieur the cardinal.”\n\nJupiter breathed once more.\n\n“Messeigneurs the bourgeois,” he cried, at the top of his lungs to the\ncrowd, which continued to hoot him, “we are going to begin at once.”\n\n“_Evoe Jupiter! Plaudite cives_! All hail, Jupiter! Applaud,\ncitizens!” shouted the scholars.\n\n“Noel! Noel! good, good,” shouted the people.\n\nThe hand clapping was deafening, and Jupiter had already withdrawn under\nhis tapestry, while the hall still trembled with acclamations.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the personage who had so magically turned the tempest\ninto dead calm, as our old and dear Corneille puts it, had modestly\nretreated to the half-shadow of his pillar, and would, no doubt, have\nremained invisible there, motionless, and mute as before, had he not been\nplucked by the sleeve by two young women, who, standing in the front row\nof the spectators, had noticed his colloquy with Michel Giborne-Jupiter.\n\n“Master,” said one of them, making him a sign to approach. “Hold your\ntongue, my dear Liénarde,” said her neighbor, pretty, fresh, and very\nbrave, in consequence of being dressed up in her best attire. “He is not a\nclerk, he is a layman; you must not say master to him, but messire.”\n",

    "title": "Chapter III: Monsieur the Cardinal",
    "ID": "88cba5b9-7b37-4150-b08b-8d67dd28ef9f",
    "description": "Monsieur the Cardinal",
    "content": "Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean,\nthe discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that\nfamous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris,\non Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians\nat one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the\nTemple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic\nmoment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His\neminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.”\n\nIt is not that Pierre Gringoire either feared or disdained monsieur the\ncardinal. He had neither the weakness nor the audacity for that. A true\neclectic, as it would be expressed nowadays, Gringoire was one of those\nfirm and lofty, moderate and calm spirits, which always know how to bear\nthemselves amid all circumstances (_stare in dimidio rerum_), and who\nare full of reason and of liberal philosophy, while still setting store by\ncardinals. A rare, precious, and never interrupted race of philosophers to\nwhom wisdom, like another Ariadne, seems to have given a clew of thread\nwhich they have been walking along unwinding since the beginning of the\nworld, through the labyrinth of human affairs. One finds them in all ages,\never the same; that is to say, always according to all times. And, without\nreckoning our Pierre Gringoire, who may represent them in the fifteenth\ncentury if we succeed in bestowing upon him the distinction which he\ndeserves, it certainly was their spirit which animated Father du Breul,\nwhen he wrote, in the sixteenth, these naively sublime words, worthy of\nall centuries: “I am a Parisian by nation, and a Parrhisian in language,\nfor _parrhisia_ in Greek signifies liberty of speech; of which I have\nmade use even towards messeigneurs the cardinals, uncle and brother to\nMonsieur the Prince de Conty, always with respect to their greatness, and\nwithout offending any one of their suite, which is much to say.”\n\nThere was then neither hatred for the cardinal, nor disdain for his\npresence, in the disagreeable impression produced upon Pierre Gringoire.\nQuite the contrary; our poet had too much good sense and too threadbare a\ncoat, not to attach particular importance to having the numerous allusions\nin his prologue, and, in particular, the glorification of the dauphin, son\nof the Lion of France, fall upon the most eminent ear. But it is not\ninterest which predominates in the noble nature of poets. I suppose that\nthe entity of the poet may be represented by the number ten; it is certain\nthat a chemist on analyzing and pharmacopolizing it, as Rabelais says,\nwould find it composed of one part interest to nine parts of self-esteem.\n\nNow, at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal, the\nnine parts of self-esteem in Gringoire, swollen and expanded by the breath\nof popular admiration, were in a state of prodigious augmentation, beneath\nwhich disappeared, as though stifled, that imperceptible molecule of which\nwe have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets; a precious\ningredient, by the way, a ballast of reality and humanity, without which\nthey would not touch the earth. Gringoire enjoyed seeing, feeling,\nfingering, so to speak an entire assembly (of knaves, it is true, but what\nmatters that?) stupefied, petrified, and as though asphyxiated in the\npresence of the incommensurable tirades which welled up every instant from\nall parts of his bridal song. I affirm that he shared the general\nbeatitude, and that, quite the reverse of La Fontaine, who, at the\npresentation of his comedy of the “Florentine,” asked, “Who is the\nill-bred lout who made that rhapsody?” Gringoire would gladly have\ninquired of his neighbor, “Whose masterpiece is this?”\n\nThe reader can now judge of the effect produced upon him by the abrupt and\nunseasonable arrival of the cardinal.\n\nThat which he had to fear was only too fully realized. The entrance of his\neminence upset the audience. All heads turned towards the gallery. It was\nno longer possible to hear one’s self. “The cardinal! The cardinal!”\nrepeated all mouths. The unhappy prologue stopped short for the second\ntime.\n\nThe cardinal halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade. While he\nwas sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the tumult\nredoubled. Each person wished to get a better view of him. Each man vied\nwith the other in thrusting his head over his neighbor’s shoulder.\n\nHe was, in fact, an exalted personage, the sight of whom was well worth\nany other comedy. Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, Archbishop and Comte of\nLyon, Primate of the Gauls, was allied both to Louis XI., through his\nbrother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king’s eldest\ndaughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of Burgundy.\nNow, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the\ncharacter of the Primate of the Gauls, was the spirit of the courtier, and\ndevotion to the powers that be. The reader can form an idea of the\nnumberless embarrassments which this double relationship had caused him,\nand of all the temporal reefs among which his spiritual bark had been\nforced to tack, in order not to suffer shipwreck on either Louis or\nCharles, that Scylla and that Charybdis which had devoured the Duc de\nNemours and the Constable de Saint-Pol. Thanks to Heaven’s mercy, he had\nmade the voyage successfully, and had reached home without hindrance. But\nalthough he was in port, and precisely because he was in port, he never\nrecalled without disquiet the varied haps of his political career, so long\nuneasy and laborious. Thus, he was in the habit of saying that the year\n1476 had been “white and black” for him—meaning thereby, that in the\ncourse of that year he had lost his mother, the Duchesse de la\nBourbonnais, and his cousin, the Duke of Burgundy, and that one grief had\nconsoled him for the other.",

    "description": "Master Jacques Coppenole",
    "content": "While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low\nbows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a\nlarge face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter\nabreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by\nthe side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the\nvelvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who\nhad stolen in, the usher stopped him.\n\n“Hold, my friend, you cannot pass!”\n\nThe man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.\n\n“What does this knave want with me?” said he, in stentorian tones, which\nrendered the entire hall attentive to this strange colloquy. “Don’t you\nsee that I am one of them?”\n\n“Your name?” demanded the usher.\n\n“Jacques Coppenole.”\n\n“Your titles?”\n\n“Hosier at the sign of the ‘Three Little Chains,’ of Ghent.”\n\nThe usher recoiled. One might bring one’s self to announce aldermen and\nburgomasters, but a hosier was too much. The cardinal was on thorns. All\nthe people were staring and listening. For two days his eminence had been\nexerting his utmost efforts to lick these Flemish bears into shape, and to\nrender them a little more presentable to the public, and this freak was\nstartling. But Guillaume Rym, with his polished smile, approached the\nusher.\n\n“Announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the city of\nGhent,” he whispered, very low.\n\n“Usher,” interposed the cardinal, aloud, “announce Master Jacques\nCoppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the illustrious city of Ghent.”\n\nThis was a mistake. Guillaume Rym alone might have conjured away the\ndifficulty, but Coppenole had heard the cardinal.\n\n“No, cross of God?” he exclaimed, in his voice of thunder, “Jacques\nCoppenole, hosier. Do you hear, usher? Nothing more, nothing less. Cross\nof God! hosier; that’s fine enough. Monsieur the Archduke has more than\nonce sought his _gant_\\* in my hose.”\n\n_*  Got the first idea of a timing._\n\nLaughter and applause burst forth. A jest is always understood in Paris,\nand, consequently, always applauded.\n\nLet us add that Coppenole was of the people, and that the auditors which\nsurrounded him were also of the people. Thus the communication between him\nand them had been prompt, electric, and, so to speak, on a level. The\nhaughty air of the Flemish hosier, by humiliating the courtiers, had\ntouched in all these plebeian souls that latent sentiment of dignity still\nvague and indistinct in the fifteenth century.\n\nThis hosier was an equal, who had just held his own before monsieur the\ncardinal. A very sweet reflection to poor fellows habituated to respect\nand obedience towards the underlings of the sergeants of the bailiff of\nSainte-Geneviève, the cardinal’s train-bearer.\n\nCoppenole proudly saluted his eminence, who returned the salute of the\nall-powerful bourgeois feared by Louis XI. Then, while Guillaume Rym, a\n“sage and malicious man,” as Philippe de Comines puts it, watched them\nboth with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place, the\ncardinal quite abashed and troubled, Coppenole tranquil and haughty, and\nthinking, no doubt, that his title of hosier was as good as any other,\nafter all, and that Marie of Burgundy, mother to that Marguerite whom\nCoppenole was to-day bestowing in marriage, would have been less afraid of\nthe cardinal than of the hosier; for it is not a cardinal who would have\nstirred up a revolt among the men of Ghent against the favorites of the\ndaughter of Charles the Bold; it is not a cardinal who could have\nfortified the populace with a word against her tears and prayers, when the\nMaid of Flanders came to supplicate her people in their behalf, even at\nthe very foot of the scaffold; while the hosier had only to raise his\nleather elbow, in order to cause to fall your two heads, most illustrious\nseigneurs, Guy d’Hymbercourt and Chancellor Guillaume Hugonet.",
